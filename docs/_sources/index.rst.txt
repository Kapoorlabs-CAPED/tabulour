``tabulous`` is a Qt based table data viewer for Python.

This package is strongly inspired by `napari <https://github.com/napari/napari>`_
in the design and API. Accordingly, custom widget creation is easily achievable
for beginners using `magicgui <https://github.com/napari/magicgui>`_, or any
Qt widgets for more trained users.
