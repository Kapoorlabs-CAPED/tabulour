If a table is editable, you can edit the values with your keyboard. If you are editing
on a ``Table``, data type will be checked.

Toolbar
=======

Toolbar contains many functions that help you with the table data.

You can "click" any buttons  in the toolbar using the keyboard; push ``Alt`` to change
focus to the toolbar, and follow the tooltip labels to find the appropriate key combo
to get to the button you want (similar to Microsoft Office).
